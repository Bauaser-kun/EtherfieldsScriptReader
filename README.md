This is free app with a purpose of opening pdf formated scripts and associated mp3 formatted audio files. 
The idea was that the pdf script will be shown on the screen while running audiofile with reading script at the same time.

Since we do not have ownership over selected scripts you need to obtain and add them yourself.

HOW TO ADD SCRIPTS:
Install android studio on your PC, copy this project. Add pdf and associated mp3 files to assets folder.
!CAUTION the mp3 and pdf file must be named the same, the app assumes that the files will be only numbered.

build the realease version of app, copy and install it on your mobile device
